# Rays-Cashout

At the time when I created this program, there was no program in place to monitor the sales of individuals and allocate tips based on
individual performance. there was just a piece of paper which had servers sales printed via POS (point of sale) system. I developed a java 
program that tracks individual sales and allocates tips based on a percentage of that individual's sales. My program enabled my employer 
to be more efficient in the management of his employees.
