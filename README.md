# Rays-Cashout

At the time I created this program, there was no program in place to monitor the sales of individuals and allocate tips based on
individual performance. Every night servers had to do the math and it took about 5-10 minutes per person each day. I developed a java 
program which would track individual sales and allocates tips based on a percentage of that individual's sales. My program enabled my
employer to be more efficient in the management of the employees.

I made this program quickly, and without any collaboration. So I'm sorry for the inproper naming convention. 


This is the splash screen displayed while the prgram loads

Here is after it has loaded and the user will then enter the data on the left-hand side, for everything that applies.

Then After the user hits "Cashout" the fields are filled and the user can get the tip outs for each individual.
