# Rays-Cashout

Rays cashout is a desktop application designed to save time, avoid errors. Every night servers have to do math to figure out tipouts for supporting staff members, and fork over money to the credit card companies. It takes about 5 minutes per person each day, and about 10 servers on shift at a time in the restaurant. I developed a Java program which would track individual sales and allocates tips based on a percentage of that individual's sales. This program enabled my employer to save money by not having staff waste time with simple math.

Building this was a great learning experience because I got to use the GUI builder in Netbeans IDE. I had very little experiece prior so this was a fun way to learn. 

This is the splash screen displayed while the prgram loads

Here is after it has loaded and the user will then enter the data on the left-hand side, for everything that applies.

Then After the user hits "Cashout" the fields are filled and the user can get the tip outs for each individual.
